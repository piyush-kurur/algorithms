# Assignment 0

This assignment will not be graded. It is meant to familiarize you
with the online judge which will be used for programming assignments
in this course.

1. You can access the judge at http://aca.cse.iitk.ac.in/cs345

2. Go to the signup page and create an account for yourself.

   * Enter your roll no. in the 'Login' and 'Team name' fields.

   * Choose 'Participants' as the category.

   * Enter your name in the 'Members' field.

3. After you sign up and login to the judge, go to the problems page
   to view the assignment problem. This assignment consists of a
   single problem 'Hello World'.

4. You can upload your solutions from the problem page. The languages
   allowed are C, C++, Java and Python.

5. After you submit, the judge will show one of the following results:

   * Correct

   * Wrong-answer: Your program gave incorrect output on one or more
     test cases. (There is only one case in this assignment)

   * Compiler-error: You can click on the submission to view the
     error.

   * Timelimit: Your program took longer than the maximum allowed time
     for this problem. Note that the timelimit is relaxed by a factor
     of 2 for Java and 3 for Python.

   * Run-error: Possible causes are a segmentation fault, very high
     memory usage, division by zero and a non-zero exit code.

Keep the following things in mind while submitting your solution:

* Make sure you strictly follow the specified output format. Printing
  anything else will give you a 'wrong-answer'. However, any trailing
  white-space will be ignored and will not cause a 'wrong-answer'.

* Your program should return 0 as the exit code. If you are
  programming in C or C++, remember to write <code>return 0;</code> at
  the end of your main function.

* If you are programming in Java, the main class should be `Main`,
  with method `public static void main(String args[])`

Feel free to make multiple submissions to get familiar with the
system. You may submit wrong solutions to see how things work.

In case of any queries, you can use the 'request clarification' option
on the 'Overview' page or send a mail to <harsh@cse.iitk.ac.in> or
<pratikkr@cse.iitk.ac.in>.
