10 marks each

1. Implement union-find data structure in your favourite language. Use
   this data structure give an implementation of Kruskal's algorithm.

2. Implement using an array a binary min-heap which also supports
   decrement-key. Use this to implement Prim's algorithm for MST.

Your program should take the input graph in the following format: The
very first line just contains a single non-negative integer which is
the number of nodes $n$. This is followed by a series of lines which
consists of the following:

```shell
u v w
```

where u and v are integers such that 0 <= u,v <= n - 1 and w is a
double precision number. The above line means that there is an
undirected edge between u to v of weight w.

Please make sure that your program adhere to the above format as we
might run your code through automated testing program.
